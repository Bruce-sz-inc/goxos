handleforwarded: this might be wrong. We can only use forwarded ep's if we also received a ep from the sender.
grpmgr :48 why do this as a goroutine. Probably to do it nonblocking. Would it not be better to simply have a buffered channel?

QUESTION1: can it happen, that a epochpromise arrives, before the new node has done failureHandlingStart() 
SOLUTION:(TODO) move the initdataresponse and maybe remove the
initdataresponseack.

question2: Is it possible to start FH and LD before initializing/starting Paxos?
Not Needed now.

TASK3: Check, if we can handle reconf/newconf messages concurrently with doing
createAndSendReconfCmd. Check unique access.

PROBLEM4: When connecting to a new node, GxConnect, the demuxer does a check
(validateId()), which returns false, if the Paxos id is out of bound. This
could be a problem, when using arec to change to a larger configuration.

TASK5: Is the lock on reconfInProgress really needed, and can we instead use
valid or statefull?

problem6:Update nodeId:the current implementation does not support this. It
might be possible to implement this on top of the grpmgr hold. But not every
agent, using the id has this hold, e.g. the proposer not.
SOLUTION: Global Ids.

TASK8: Decouple round from Acceptor Slots. Adjust also getAcceptorState,
acceptor.SetState and the extractAcceptorState(lr/arec) methods.

QUESTION9: After activation, should a CPromise be answered by an activation
message?

IDEA11: RECONNECT: Solution: We want to have GxConnections to those servers 
that we think will eventually run Paxos. Communication with other should 
use other means. To avoid accepting paxos messages from other epochs, 
we can simply temper with the ProposerRound.Compare method, to always return -1, 
if the epoch is different.

QUESTION12: Upon changing the id, should we still implement a method, 
that tells others to update aswell, s.t. they can update the id stored in their connection.

QUESTION13: Can I change the exported function GxConnect to first look up, 
if the node exists in the map, and only connect if it does not?

TODO14: Include global id's in arec.

QUESTION15: How should we pass the AduSlot included in the activation message
to paxos modul?

TASK16: Insert Arec in config/variants.go

TASH17: Write unittest for init_areconf.go
